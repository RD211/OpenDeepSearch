Let me start by looking through the context given. \n\nThe user mentioned "Road to Mother", which I see in the search results under the first entry titled "Azamat Satybaldy - Wikipedia". In the snippet provided, under the filmography section, it lists "2016, The Road to Mother, Hamite". That seems to directly answer the question. The year here is 2016.\n\nI should check other sources to confirm. Another result is "A Road To Mother (Kazakhstan) - Golden Globes" dated December 16, 2016. The snippet mentions the film\'s storyline but doesn\'t specify the release year. However, since the article was published in 2016 and the Wikipedia entry lists 2016 as the year for his role, that\'s consistent. \n\nThe other entries like "The Legend of Tomiris" and others don\'t relate to "Road to Mother". The Kazakhstan State.gov page and other PDFs are unrelated. The Wikipedia entry is the most reliable here, as per the guidelines. Since there\'s no conflicting information and the Answer Box isn\'t mentioned, but the Wikipedia entry is authoritative, I can confidently say the year is 2016.\n</think>\n\nAzamat Satybaldy appeared in *The Road to Mother* in **2016**, as noted in his filmography on Wikipedia, where he played the role of Hamite.', 'Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan', 'Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan', 'Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan']

Query: What medal was won in 1979 by the famous physicist who attended the oldest college in London?
Answers: ['Roger Penrose did not win a notable medal in 1979. The closest awards mentioned are the Eddington Medal in 1975 and the Royal Medal in 1985.', "The provided context does not mention any famous physicist who attended St George's University of London and won a medal in 1979. Stephen Hawking, while a renowned physicist, did not attend St George's University of London.", 'Thomas Young, the 19th-century scientist, died in 1829 and could not have received any awards in 1979. The mentions of 1979 are related to other individuals, such as David Andrews and A. Thomas Young. Therefore, the question might be based on a misunderstanding.', "No famous physicist who attended St George's, University of London and won a medal in 1979 was found. However, Stephen Hawking, who attended the University of Cambridge, won the Albert Einstein Medal in 1979.", 'Margaret Maureen Hurst', 'Nobel Prize', 'None', 'No prominent physicist linked to UCL is noted in the provided context as receiving a medal in 1979.', 'Margaret Maureen Hurst', 'Okay, let\'s tackle this question step by step. The user is asking about a famous physicist who won a medal in 1979 and attended St George\'s, University of London. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the query. The key points are: the physicist is famous, they won a medal in 1979, and they attended St George\'s, University of London. \n\nLooking at the provided search results, I\'ll start by checking the entries related to St George\'s, University of London. The Wikipedia page for St George\'s lists notable alumni, but the snippet mentions J. K. Acquaye, who is a hematologist, not a physicist. The other snippet from City St George\'s history doesn\'t mention any physicists either. So maybe the connection to St George\'s is not directly through the alumni list here. Alternatively, perhaps the user might have confused the university name, but I need to check all possibilities.\n\nNext, focusing on the 1979 medal. The first result is Stephen Hawking\'s Wikipedia page. It states that between 1979 and 2009, he was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge. The snippet also mentions awards he received, including the Albert Einstein Medal in 1978 and others. However, in 1979, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam, and Steven Weinberg, as seen in the NobelPrize.org and Britannica entries. \n\nWait, the user is asking for someone who both won a medal in 1979 and attended St George\'s. Stephen Hawking\'s page doesn\'t mention St George\'s University. The St George\'s entries don\'t list any famous physicists from 1979. The Nobel Prize winners in 1979 are Glashow, Salam, and Weinberg. None of them are linked to St George\'s. \n\nHmm, maybe there\'s a misunderstanding. Let me check again. The user might have confused the university. Alternatively, perhaps the medal isn\'t the Nobel Prize. The Hawking page mentions he was appointed a professor in 1977 and received the Albert Einstein Medal in 1978. The 1979 year for his professorship might be a red herring. \n\nWait, the question says "won medal in 1979". The Nobel Prize in Physics that year was in 1979, so the three laureates are candidates. But none attended St George\'s. The other medal mentioned in Hawking\'s page is the Wolf Prize in 1988, which is later. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the user is conflating the university with another institution. St George\'s, University of London is a medical school primarily. The notable alumni listed are in medicine. The other St George\'s history mentions business and professions, but not physics. \n\nIs there any mention of a medal in 1979 connected to St George\'s? The only other mention is the "Medal for Science Communication" in Hawking\'s entry, but the date isn\'t specified. \n\nWait, the user might have made an error in the university name. Maybe they meant another institution? Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that there\'s no such person in the provided context. \n\nLooking again at the search results, the only physicist mentioned with a 1979 connection is Hawking\'s professorship starting in 1979, but he didn\'t attend St George\'s. The Nobel winners that year didn\'t either. \n\nTherefore, based on the given context, there\'s no information linking a famous physicist who both won a medal in 1979 and attended St George\'s, University of London. The answer would have to state that the query can\'t be answered with the provided information.\n</think>\n\nThe query asks for a famous physicist who won a medal in 1979 and attended St George\'s, University of London. Based on the provided context:  \n\n- **Stephen Hawking** was the Lucasian Professor of Mathematics at Cambridge from **1979** onward, but he did not attend St George\'s, University of London.

The answer cannot be confirmed with the provided sources.', "There is no mention of a 'Wheatstone Medal' awarded in 1979. However, the Royal Medal of the Royal Society was awarded to Charles Frank in Physics and Hans Walter Kosterlitz in Biology in 1979.", "The provided search results do not mention any famous physicist affiliated with St George's, University of London who won a medal in 1979.

I need to look through the provided search results to find the answer.\n\nFirst, I\'ll check the ANSWER BOX, but since there\'s no specific answer box mentioned here, I\'ll move to the next reliable sources. Wikipedia is listed, so that\'s a good start. The Wikipedia snippet says they specialize in caring for those with terminal cancer who have no financial resources. \n\nLooking at the other results: The "About Us" page from their own site mentions nursing incurable cancer patients who can\'t afford care. The Rosary Hill Home services also mention palliative care for such patients. Another link from Our Lady of Peace talks about caring for the dying with free care. The YouTube snippets reinforce the focus on terminal cancer and preaching love through care.\n\nAll the sources consistently point to terminal or incurable cancer patients, especially those without financial means. There\'s no conflicting information here. The key points are terminal cancer, no financial resources, and palliative care. \n\nSo the answer should state that they specialize in treating terminal cancer patients who can\'t afford care. I\'ll make sure to mention the financial aspect since it\'s a common point in all sources. No need to add extra details unless necessary. Since the question is straightforward, the answer should be concise.\n</think>\n\nThe Dominican Sisters of Hawthorne specialize in treating **terminal cancer patients**, particularly those who cannot afford care.

Query: Which Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 made contributions to quantum theory, and what were their specific contributions? List the laureates and their respective contributions.
Answers: ["Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 who made contributions to quantum theory:\n\nMax Planck was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Physics for his groundbreaking discovery of energy quanta, which laid the foundation for quantum theory. His work introduced the concept that energy is quantized (transferred or emitted in discrete amounts), represented by Planck's constant (h). This contribution is widely recognized as the birth of quantum theory.\n\nPhilipp Lenard was awarded the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physics for his work on cathode rays, specifically studying their properties and behavior. While his Nobel contribution was not directly to quantum theory, his experimental work on the photoelectric effect—showing that the energy of ejected electrons depends on the frequency, not the intensity, of incident light—laid foundational data for Albert Einstein's 1905 quantum theory of light. Einstein used Lenard's findings to propose photons, earning Einstein his own 1921 Nobel Prize. Lenard's experiments thus indirectly advanced quantum theory, though his Nobel citation focused on cathode rays.", "The Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 who contributed to quantum theory include Max Planck (1918), honored for his foundational work introducing quantized energy in 1900, and Philipp Lenard (1905), recognized for his experiments on cathode rays and the photoelectric effect, which later influenced Einstein's quantum explanation.", "Max Planck (1918) for his foundational work introducing quantized energy in 1900, and Philipp Lenard (1905) for his experiments on cathode rays and the photoelectric effect, which later influenced Einstein's quantum explanation.", [{'year': 1918, 'laureate': 'Max Planck', 'contribution': 'Quantum theory and the law of energy exchange'}, {'year': 1902, 'laureate': 'Hendrik Lorentz and Pieter Zeeman', 'contribution': 'Zeeman effect'}, {'year': 1919, 'laureate': 'Johannes Stark', 'contribution': 'Stark effect'}], {'Max Planck (1918)': 'Honored for his foundational work on quantum theory, specifically the law of black-body radiation.', 'Johannes Stark (1919)': 'Recognized for the discovery of the Stark effect, which revealed how electric fields influence the spectral lines of atoms, a key quantum mechanical phenomenon.'}, [{'year': 1919, 'name': 'Johannes Stark', 'contribution': 'Stark effect and atomic spectra'}, {'year': 1918, 'name': 'Max Planck', 'contribution': 'Quantum hypothesis and black-body radiation'}], 'Max Planck (1918): Quantum hypothesis', [{'year': 1918, 'laureate': 'Max Planck', 'contribution': 'Introduction of the concept of energy quanta, which laid the foundation of quantum theory.'}, {'year': 1919, 'laureate': 'Johannes Stark', 'contribution': 'Discovery of the Stark effect, which provided experimental evidence for quantum theory.'}, {'year': 1921, 'laureate': 'Albert Einstein', 'contribution': 'Explanation of the photoelectric effect, which was foundational for quantum theory.'}, {'year': 1922, 'laureate': 'Niels Bohr', 'contribution': 'Development of the quantum theory of the atom, explaining atomic structure and electron behavior.'}], [{'name': 'Max Planck', 'year': 1918, 'contribution': 'Introduction of the quantum hypothesis, which proposed that energy is emitted or absorbed in discrete packets called quanta.'}, {'name': 'Philipp Lenard', 'year': 1905, 'contribution': "Experimental work on cathode rays and the photoelectric effect, which provided crucial data for Einstein's quantum theory of light."}], ['Philipp Lenard (1905): for his work on cathode rays and the discovery of the photoelectric effect, which was later explained using quantum theory by Einstein.'], [{'year': 1918, 'name': 'Max Planck', 'contribution': 'Quantum theory and Planck’s law'}, {'year': 1919, 'name': 'Johannes Stark', 'contribution': 'Stark effect, splitting of spectral lines in electric fields'}], {'Max Planck': '1918 for his discovery of energy quanta, which laid the foundation for quantum theory.', 'Johannes Stark': '1919 for his discovery of the Stark effect, which involves the splitting of spectral lines in electric fields and provided critical evidence for early quantum mechanics.', 'Wilhelm Wien': '1911 for his displacement law concerning the radiation of heat, which contributed to the development of quantum mechanics through his work on adiabatic invariance.', 'Pieter Zeeman': '1902 (shared with Hendrik Lorentz) for the discovery of the Zeeman effect, which involves the splitting of spectral lines in a magnetic field and later became foundational in the development of quantum theory.'}]
Final Result: The Nobel laureates in Physics between 1901 and 1920 who made contributions to quantum theory are:

- Max Planck (1918): Honored for his foundational work on quantum theory, specifically the introduction of the concept of energy quanta and the law of black-body radiation.
- Philipp Lenard (1905): Recognized for his experimental work on cathode rays and the photoelectric effect, which provided crucial data for Einstein's quantum theory of light, although his Nobel Prize was awarded for his work on cathode rays.
